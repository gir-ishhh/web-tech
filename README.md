Simple E-Commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website created as a second-year BCA Web Technology project. The entire website is built using only front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the core functionalities of an online store, including browsing products, adding items to a cart, and a checkout process, without needing a backend server or database.

Features ‚ú®
- Multi-Page Navigation: A complete 6-page website (Home, Products, About Us, Contact, Cart, and Checkout).
- Dynamic Product Listing: Products are loaded dynamically onto the page using JavaScript.
- Interactive Shopping Cart: Users can add items to a shopping cart, and the cart count updates across the site.
- Persistent Cart: The shopping cart remembers its contents even when you switch pages or refresh the browser, thanks to localStorage.
- Interactive "About Us" Page: Features a "Meet the Team" section and a dynamic FAQ accordion.
- Simulated Checkout Process: A checkout form that validates user input, simulates an order, and clears the cart.
- Modern & Catchy Design: Styled with custom CSS, Google Fonts, and hover effects for a better user experience.

Technologies Used üíª
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling, layout (Flexbox, Grid), and animations.
JavaScript (ES6): For all the dynamic functionality, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing the shopping cart with localStorage.
